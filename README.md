# Mazer-CPP

This project implements a maze generation and solving algorithm in C++.

## Description

Mazer-CPP is a C++ project that provides algorithms for generating mazes and solving them. 

I've written a better implementation of this same project, using the same algorithms in rust, which can be found [here](https://github.com/silky-curtains/mazer-rust).

## How to Compile and Run

### Requisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

To compile `main.cpp`

```bash
$ g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
```

To run the compiled executable `main.exe`

```bash
$ ./main.exe
```

You will be prompted to input the size of maze to be generated and solved.
